# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

#Description
This game is a text based adventure. You start off in a scene where you have to do battle with a skeleton. You then have a choice
of either escaping or returning to your master. The code branches off from the first choice into various other paths.
Each choice you make can impact you at a later point in the game, or end the game right at that spot. Each path is unique
and offers a variety of choices that keeps the game interesting with multiple endings.
