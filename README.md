# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

#Description
This game is a text based adventure. You start in a single room with two choices presented to you. Once you make your choice,
there is no going back and you start on your adventure. The code branches off from the first choice into various other paths.
Each choice you make can impact you at a later point in the game. Since it is a text based adventure, there is no actual combat, but
the choices you make when encountering enemies allow you to come out victorious, or lose. The class I used is just a stylistic choice
for the player to choose from, but every other choice they make is crucial for their success.
